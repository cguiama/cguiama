## Hello there! Welcome to my Github

- Iâ€™m interested in learn code and change my currently working area;
- Iâ€™m currently learning Git, C and Java at Alura and I'm studying systems analysis and development at Anhembi Morumbi university --> https://www.alura.com.br/ https://portal.anhembi.br/graduacao/cursos/tecnologia-em-analise-e-desenvolvimento-de-sistemas/ ;
- All my life, I've worked with archviz "www.behance.com/inside3d" but I've always been interested in coding and i decided to work in a broader market that will make it possible to fly even higher;
- I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo and as I study remotely, I'm available to travel;
- How to reach me? <send me a message> ðŸ“«;
